The Vienna Computing Library (\ViennaCL) is a scientific computing
library written in C++. It allows simple, high-level access
to the vast computing resources available on parallel architectures such as
GPUs and multi-core CPUs by using either a host-based computing backend, an {\OpenCL} computing backend, or {\CUDA}.
The primary focus is on common linear algebra
operations (BLAS levels 1, 2 and 3) and the solution of large sparse systems of equations by means of iterative
methods. In {\ViennaCLminorversion}, the following iterative solvers are
implemented (confer for example to the book of Y.~Saad \cite{saad-iterative-solution}):
\begin{itemize}
 \item Conjugate Gradient (CG)
 \item Stabilized BiConjugate Gradient (BiCGStab)
 \item Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES)
\end{itemize}
A number of preconditioners is provided with {\ViennaCLversion} in order to improve convergence of these solvers, cf.~Chap.~\ref{chap:algorithms}.

The solvers and preconditioners can also be used with different
libraries due to their generic implementation. At present, it is possible to
use the solvers and preconditioners directly with types from the {\ublas} library, which is part of
{\Boost} \cite{boost}. The iterative solvers can directly be used with Eigen \cite{eigen} and MTL 4 \cite{mtl4}.

Under the hood, {\ViennaCL} uses a unified layer to access {\CUDA} \cite{nvidiacuda}, {\OpenCL} \cite{khronoscl}, and/or {\OpenMP} \cite{openmp} for accessing and
executing code on compute devices. Therefore, {\ViennaCL} is not tailored
to products from a particular vendor and can be used on many different
platforms. At present, {\ViennaCL} is known to work on all current CPUs and modern GPUs from NVIDIA
and AMD (see Tab.~\ref{tab:double-precision-GPUs}), CPUs
using either the AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing (APP) SDK (formerly ATI Stream SDK) or the Intel OpenCL SDK, and Intels MIC platform (Xeon Phi).

\NOTE{Double precision arithmetic on GPUs is only possible if it is provided by the GPU. There is no double precision emulation in {\ViennaCL}.}

\NOTE{Double precision arithmetic using the ATI Stream SDK or AMD APP SDK may not be fully
OpenCL-certified. Also, we have observed bugs in AMD APP SDKs 2.7 which effects some algorithms in {\ViennaCL} (e.g.~BiCGStab).}

release of {\ViennaCLversion}, the Stream SDK (APP SDK) from AMD/ATI may not comply to
the {\OpenCL} standard for double precision extensions, and we have observed
problems with the APP SDK 2.7 on Linux in both single- and double-precision.}
