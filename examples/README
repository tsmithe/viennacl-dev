This directory contains examples for how to use PyViennaCL.

Read them! The comments are very explanatory :-)

If you need more example code, the tests (under ../tests) cover the
full PyViennaCL API, and so provide examples of that usage, even if
the tests are somewhat contrived.

Otherwise, the next best thing is the in-built documentation

>>> import pyviennacl
>>> help(pyviennacl)

which is also built into HTML documentation using the Sphinx system,
and should be located in build/doc (if you built the sources 
yourself); otherwise, if you are on a Debian or Ubuntu system, look
in /usr/share/doc/pyviennacl-doc.

Finally, if you are still struggling, then play around or read the
source!
